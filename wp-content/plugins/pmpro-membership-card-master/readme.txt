Display a printable Membership Card for Paid Memberships Pro members or WP users.

== Description ==

If Paid Memberships Pro is activated, then only members will be able to view the membership card. If not, the card will show for all WP users.

Specify the print size of the cards to display using the shortcode attribute "print_size". Sizes include small (roughly the size of a credit card), medium (slightly larger than credit card size), and large (roughly half sheet size).

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `pmpro-membership-card` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory of your site.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
1. Create a page and add the [pmpro_membership_card] shortcode to it.
1. (Optional) The page's "featured image" will be added to the membership card.
1. (Optional) Specify the shortcode attribute 'print_size'. Options include: small, medium, large or all. Default is: all. (ex: [pmpro_membership_card print_size="small,medium"])
1. (Optional) Copy the pmpro-membership-card/templates/membership-card.php file to your active theme's directory and edit it to change the card template.
